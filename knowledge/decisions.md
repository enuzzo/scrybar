## 2026-02-28 - Public Cross-Assistant Knowledge Layer

- Context: Project needs a provider-agnostic memory layer reusable by Codex, Claude, Gemini, and humans.
- Decision: Keep shared instructions and stable knowledge in versioned `knowledge/`; keep private operational logs in local non-versioned folders.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: Better portability and transparency; less room for private/debug detail in public docs, which must stay sanitized.
