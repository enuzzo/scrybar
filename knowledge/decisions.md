## 2026-02-28 - Public Cross-Assistant Knowledge Layer

- Context: Project needs a provider-agnostic memory layer reusable by Codex, Claude, Gemini, and humans.
- Decision: Keep shared instructions and stable knowledge in versioned `knowledge/`; keep private operational logs in local non-versioned folders.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: Better portability and transparency; less room for private/debug detail in public docs, which must stay sanitized.

## 2026-02-28 - LV_COLOR_16_SWAP=1 for AXS15231B Display

- Context: AXS15231B display controller expects RGB565 bytes in big-endian order; default LVGL output is little-endian, producing wrong colors.
- Decision: Set `LV_COLOR_16_SWAP=1` in `lv_conf.h` as a permanent baseline for this hardware.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: Correct colors on the target display; frame dumps on wire are `rgb565be` and must be decoded accordingly by capture tools.

## 2026-02-28 - Hard Power-Off Not Mapped to Physical Button

- Context: Mapping hard-off to the physical button risked device entering a non-recoverable state (requiring a hardware power cycle) from an accidental long-press.
- Decision: Hard-off is only accessible via serial command `PWROFFHARD`; the physical button handles soft-off (5s) and wake (5–6s) only.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: Safer user-facing UX with no accidental hard lock; technical hard-off still reachable for diagnostics.

## 2026-02-28 - Word Clock as Natural Italian Sentence

- Context: Two display styles were considered: uppercase block-word (common scrabble-tile aesthetic) and lowercase natural sentence.
- Decision: Use natural Italian sentence form via `composeWordClockSentenceIt` — no uppercase blocks.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: More readable at a glance and consistent with the "readable, not gimmicky" product principle; requires a dedicated large font (`Montserrat 38`) for legibility.

## 2026-02-28 - full_refresh=1 in LVGL Display Driver

- Context: Partial refresh with the current software rotation on AXS15231B produced tearing and buffer misalignment artifacts.
- Decision: Set `full_refresh=1` in the LVGL display driver as permanent baseline.
- Impact/Tradeoffs: Eliminates tearing artifacts; marginally higher bus bandwidth per frame, acceptable on this hardware.
